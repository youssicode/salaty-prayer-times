### Overview

**Salaty - Prayer Times** offers a convenient way for Muslims to track their daily prayers and stay connected to their faith. By leveraging geolocation services, the app provides precise prayer times for any location worldwide. The application also features an Islamic calendar, notifications for prayer times, and a map to find nearby mosques, making it a complete solution for daily prayer management.

The application was built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The user interface was crafted with HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript, while the back-end infrastructure was developed using Node.js and Express. External APIs (listed in the About section) were used to retrieve prayer times, geolocation data, and other relevant information. These APIs were tested using Postman. The project was designed in Figma and deployed to a hosting service.

### Features

- **Accurate Prayer Times:** Displays the five daily prayer times based on the userâ€™s current location or a selected city.

  - **Dynamic Location Detection:** Utilizes geolocation services to automatically detect the userâ€™s location.
  - **City Selection:** Includes an auto-complete search feature to help users easily find and select any city worldwide.

- **Islamic Calendar:** Displays a user-friendly Islamic (lunar) calendar, providing an overview of important dates and events.

- **Next Prayer Indicator:** Highlights the next upcoming prayer and shows the remaining time until it starts, helping users stay prepared.

- **Nearby Mosques:** Integrates Google Maps to show nearby mosques based on the user's location, making it easy to find a place to pray.

- **Athan Notifications:** Plays audio and visual notifications for the Athan (call to prayer) at the appropriate times, ensuring users never miss a prayer.

- **Daily Hadeeth:** A daily Prophet's hadeeth is displayed on larger devices or by clicking the 'Today's Hadeeth' button on mobile devices.

- **Customizable Settings:** A settings panel allows users to customize their preferences, such as saving their current location, enabling Athan notifications, and viewing the prayer times table for a chosen month.
